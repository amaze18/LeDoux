Analysts, investment banks, think tanks and global\nagencies have all provided gushing salutes to the potential of India in\nterms of its size, workforc e and geopolitical central ity. A key\nunderpinning of this optimism  is the soft infrastructure the country\nhas put in place through an industrial-scale rollout of digital\nconnectivity that has allowed people to link their bank accounts to a\nnational identity number and a mobile phone number .

The reality , as they reveal, is not\nnecessarily what the popular narrative suggests. The authors\nillustrate the various ways in which schemes like the Pradhan Mantri\nJan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) have failed to achieve real financial\ninclusion for people at the bottom of the pyramid.

If one relies entirely on\ncash, they are excluded from all the wonderful things promised by\nthe digital revolution.\nWhat Is not SHUb?\nElectronic payments are not SHUb.

We can clearly recall the stories that\nwere narrated to us in the distinct voices of our family members,\nparents, or even beloved grandparents who may have passed away .\nSometimes, even famous voices have recall: in India, for example,\nsingers such as Kishore Kumar , Lata Mangeshkar , Asha Bhosle and\nMohammed Rafi enjoy legendary status because of their inimitable\nvoices.

This app is particularly\nnoteworthy because it is the first of its kind in India to use artificial\nintelligence and machine learning to enable voice search and\nassistance, making it capable of understanding not just languages\nbut even dif ferent dialects within a language.\nThe use of voice technology in the Ujjivan Mobile Banking  app has\nseveral benefit s for users like Bhishma and Sridhar , who may not be\ncomfortable with traditional, text-based interfaces. For example, the\nrecorded audio guide on every screen provides an additional layer of\nguidance and support for account holders who may have limited\nliteracy .

His father had been a\nlender , and that\u2019s all he did. In fact, Subu got an education when\nmost of his contemporaries didn\u2019t because his father could afford it.\nBut when Subu\u2019 s father passed away suddenly in a train accident, he\nhad to put his father \u2019s shop in order . It took him months to go\nthrough the meticulously maintained notebooks and track each of the\ndebtors on the list. By the time he was done, he realized  he was in\nthe thick of it. People were already borrowing from him. A\nrelationship his father had started and so assiduously cultivated\ncould not be put to an end just like that.\nAnd so, it came about that Subu just accepted his fate and\nbecame a part-time moneyle nder.

Consumers are required to try to resolve their issues\ndirectly with the service provider before escalating their complaints to\nthe Integrated Ombudsman Scheme. However , if a resolution cannot\nbe reached through the service provider , the Integrated Ombudsman\nScheme serves as a last resort where consumers can take their\ncomplaints. The two-tiered system ensures that consum ers have\nmultiple options for addressing their grievances and that the\nIntegrated Ombudsman Scheme is only utilized as a last resort.\nDespite the existence of the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme,\naccessing its mechanisms for resolving issues or complaints is not a\nstraightforward process.

Banks could engage a third-party insurance provider who\nwould basically underwrite the losses of faulty transactions, and it\ncould help streamline the redressal process even further . For\ninstance, think of how air travel is insured at the time of flight\nbooking. At a minimal cost, one can insure themselves against loss\nof baggage, flight delays, etc.\nSimilarly , all digital transactions could be brought under the scope\nof an insurance  provider . As part of the claims process, the provider\nwould immediately be able to identify disputed transactions,\ntransactions made in error or any other kind of grievance that\ncustomers may have. The comfort of knowing that an insurance\nprovider is underwriting potentially faulty transactions can boost the\nconfidence of BOP customers and would most likely encourage\nmore digital use.\nThe insurance  provider investigates each case and provides\nredressal on behalf of the bank. However , unlike insured  air travel,\nwhere delays and baggage losses are well documented, in the case\nof digital transactions, errors may be more difficult to track. In other\nwords, fraudule nt claims may rise once the customer base is aware\nthat their transactions are insured. In such cases, the insurance\nprovider could analyse any patterns or trends that emerge and\ninform the bank.

Leaving aside the inevitability of mortality ,\nsickness and death are inext ricably linked to the vagaries of nature.\nWhen it\u2019s not nature, then accidents and man-made calamities pose\na threat to life and general well-being. In essence, no human life is\nimmune to ill health, accidents, misfortune or financial losses. No\nmatter what the adversity , be it health, death, accidents,\nunemployment or the failure of the monsoons, all of these eventually\nresult in a financial crisis; such is the interconnectedness  of human\nlife and money .

You take care of me when I need help. I\nwill take care of you when you need help. That requires two things.\nGroups of people. And an ability to write social and formal contracts\n(collective intelligence and the ability to remember and reciprocate).\nHence, social institutions and social insurance.\nBut what if the entire group is threatened? That require s you to\nenlarge the group for diversification. But a larger group means less\nreliance on informal mechanisms like reciprocity . We need formal\nmechanisms called contracts, which lead to individu alism and\nreliance on market insurance.

What Raadhi needed was comprehensive health\ncoverage to diversify her risks, which she did not have.\nWhat Could I Explore that Would Lead Me to\nthe Diversification of Risk?\nThis is what the financial markets allow us to do. In the jargon of\nfinancial economics, many risks can be diversified. For example, one\ncan protect oneself against many risks by buying insurance. Many\ninsurance products, such as life insurance, automobile  insurance\nand health insurance, exist and are used by millions of people. But\nas Robert J. Shiller , Nobel Laureate in Economics, has pointed out,\nthere are many other risks we face in life\u2014for example,\nunemployment risk\u2014and the level of formal insurance, or livelihood\ninsurance, is woefully inadequate. Furthermore, in a research paper\nby Shawn Cole, Xavier Gin\u00e9, Jeremy Tobacman, Petia Topalova,\nRobert Townsend and James Vickery ,1 they show , using evidence\nfrom India, that there are many barriers that have severely limited\nthe use of formal insurance contracts. They suggest that many poor\npeople don\u2019t buy insurance because they face liquidity and credit\nconstraints, do not trust formal insurance products, and sometimes\nthe advantages of insurance, such as large payouts in adverse\nsituations, are not often visible. Innovations in the private sector that\naddress these barriers can increase the use of formal insurance\nproducts.\nWhile these solutions may work and certainly ought to be given a\nshot, we suggest a different solution altogether . We propose a\nmarriage of formal insuran ce contracts with informal insurance\nmechanisms.

This phenomenon is\nalso called the poverty premium or the poverty tax.\nThe concept of the poverty premium is relevant to many countries,\nincluding India.

These costs can take many forms, such as\nhigher prices for goods and services, higher fees for basic services,\nand higher interest rates on loans.\nBesides Manorama\u2019 s example, another example of the poverty\npremium in India is the cost of healthcare. Low-income individuals in\nIndia may have limited access to preventive care, leading to higher\ncosts for the treatment of preventable conditions. They may also be\nmore likely to rely on emergency rooms for medical care,  which can\nbe more expensive than primary care.

Any intere st that is accumulated on the principal\namount could be invested in a risky stock portfolio.\nFor instance, let\u2019s suppose you invest Rs 100 (approximately $1).\nLet us also suppose that interest on a one-year fixed deposit is 8 per\ncent per annum. One can invest Rs 92.60 (approximately $1) in a\nfixed deposit, which will grow to Rs 100 in a year. This guarantees\nthat in one year, your principal investment of Rs 100 (approximately\n$1) is guaranteed. The remaining Rs 7.40 (approximately $0.090)\ncan then be invested in a risky stock portfolio. This guarantees that\nthe minimum you will have at the end of the year is Rs 100.\nIn addition, imagine that a Rs 7.40 investment in stocks grows to\nRs 12 (approximately 0.15 which is not guaranteed). Your balance at\nthe end of the year is now Rs 112 (approximately $1.5). You can now\nbe asked again if you want to put a higher floor on your investment.\nYou are climbing a ladder , so to speak. You can decide that the new\nladder step is Rs 110 (approximately $1.5). That can now be\nguaranteed by a fixed-deposit investment of Rs 101.85\n(approximately $1.25), which at 8 per cent will grow to Rs 110. The\nremaining (Rs 112 \u2013 Rs 101.85) Rs 10.15 can again be invested in a\nrisky stock portfolio.

There are good reasons why that is the case.3\nThe argument that cash is cumbersome to carry and store, can be\nstolen or forged, remains uninvested, usually loses purchasing\npower over time, and, most importantly , cannot be transferred easily\nacross large distances, has no bite for a large section of lower-\nincome people. Digital financial services are intimidating for many\npoor people. They do not find these simple. They also mistrust\ntechnology . We have illustrat ed through the course of this book how\nthe human touch can both alleviate fears and genera te trust in\ntechnology .\nKalavati, who cooks for one of us, wanted her salary in cash.\nWhen asked why she would not prefer to have her salary directly\ndeposited into her bank account, she provided two compelling\nreasons. One, she said it was not easy for her to check quickly\nwhether the money did indeed reach her bank account. Two, she\nconfessed that she wanted to use her salary right away to buy food\nand other essential items for her household, and she said that\nmerchants where she shopped, sabjiwalas, etc., preferred cash. This\npoints to another important requirement for digital payments: they\nmust also become ubiquitous.\nAn important insight came to us serendipitously when, one day,\nKalavati sudde nly said that she would be willing to accept her salary\ndigitally if we could transfer it to her young son, who uses Paytm and\nGPay . She explained that her son would immediately call her when\nhe received a message on his smartphone that the money had been\ntransferred. A trusted human touch and an immediate confirmation\nalleviated two of her major misgivings about accepting her salary\ndigitally . We also learned that her mistrust was not with us but with\nthe digital process.\nDuring our research, we\u2019ve gathered that the use of BC agents in\nkiranas, pharmacies, shopping malls, post offices, bus and train\nstations, and other busy spaces could help people carry out simple", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2021, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77c7715c-6cb1-4fec-aee3-ac8b4eb7338a": {"__data__": {"id_": "77c7715c-6cb1-4fec-aee3-ac8b4eb7338a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "F2B.pdf", "file_path": "/content/F2B/F2B.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1358069, "creation_date": "2024-05-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-15", "entities": ["Kalavati", "Paytm", "Gpay"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "174006fb-c8ca-4f5f-a888-86b0b6246a70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "F2B.pdf", "file_path": "/content/F2B/F2B.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1358069, "creation_date": "2024-05-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-15"}, "hash": "871754f0be2131509a17531ab74b9a0e789edf691507867ad580ff1531e3501e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "transactions using mobile phones or point-of-sale devices. This\ncould go a long way towards making everyone comfortable with the\nuse of digital financial services.

DIRIs research estim ates suggest that it would cost only\naround Rs 4800 crore (approximately $585 million) each year to\nservice forty crore (400 million) customers with basic accounts.
