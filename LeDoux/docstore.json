No, it\u2019s not about reducing consciousness to \ncognition, cognition to the brain, and the brain to biology. It is \ninstead about how every thing that can be said about you as a living \n thing is subsumed by interactions between biological, neurobiolog-\nical, cognitive, and conscious ways of  being.  These are our realms \nof existence.\nAll living things, all organisms, exist biologically. But some of  these, \nnamely animals, evolved nervous systems, and so they also exist neu-\nrobiologically. Of  these, some can think and plan, and thus exist cog-\nnitively. Finally, some cognitive organisms also exist consciously. All \nthat we are is subsumed within these entwined realms of existence.\nMuch thanks to my wife, Nancy Princenthal, a fantastic writer \nand editor. With her keen eye and sharp mind she made invaluable \ncontributions. Our son, Milo LeDoux, also helped by posing chal-\nlenging questions on key topics, like animal consciousness and con-\nscious AI. It was great working with Robert Lee again. He made \nthe illustrations for my earlier book Anxious, and also created the \noriginal figures in this book.\nI am extremely grateful to colleagues who have spent time talking \nwith me about or reading drafts of  this book.

A new group of pa -\ntients was being given the \u201csplit- brain\u201d operation by a neurosurgeon \nat Dartmouth Medical School, and I got in at just the right time. \nDuring my first year, Mike bought the camper mentioned  earlier, \nand we converted it into a mobile testing lab. Over the next several \nyears, a  couple of other students and I made frequent trips to New \n England with Mike to test  these patients.\nIn his PhD studies, Mike had showed that when the brain was \nsplit, information presented to the right hemi sphere stays  there. \nThis was achieved by instructing the patient to fixate his or her \neyes on a small dot in the center of a projection screen.  Because of  \nthe way the nerves from the eye to the brain are routed, stimuli on \nthe left side of  the screen are directed to the right hemi sphere and \nstimuli to the right to the left hemi sphere. And  because language \nis preferentially represented in the left hemi sphere, the patient cannot \ntalk about information presented only to the right hemi sphere. \nFor example, if only the right hemi sphere was shown a picture of \nan apple, and the patient was asked \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d the pa -\ntient would say something like, \u201cI  didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d  because \nthe vocal left hemi sphere did not pro cess that information.

But the evidence \nat the time was not conclusive. Even a brief conversation with the \nloquacious left hemi sphere gives you the sense that you are talking \nto a full-on  human being\u2014 you hear about opinions, beliefs, mem -\nories, fears, and hopes.

Paul\u2019s right hemi sphere knew that he \nwas Paul. This is not trivial. A person\u2019s name is a key marker of  their \nidentity, a hook on which hangs much of  what is known about who \nthey are.\nBut Paul was unusual. Unlike most split- brain patients, who have \nlanguage only in their left hemi sphere, Paul could understand spoken \nand written language with both hemi spheres, despite being able to \ntalk only via his left hemi sphere. That\u2019s why we could ask his right \nhemi sphere, \u201cWho are you?\u201d and get a response.  Because the amount \nof information that can be pro cessed in a quick flash is  limited, I \nspoke part of  the question out loud and presented the rest visually. \nAs a result, both hemi spheres heard the word \u201cwho,\u201d but only the \nright hemi sphere saw \u201care you.\u201d\nIn other studies of Paul, we  were able to use  these kinds of  simple \nprobes to show that his right hemi sphere could imagine the  future. \nWhen asked what his goal in life was, the left hand, the behavioral \nagent of  the right hemi sphere, spelled out \u201crace car driver.\u201d Strik -\ningly, the left hemi sphere had declared in conversations with us that \nit wanted to be a draftsman. That two diff  er ent answers emerged \nfrom the same brain was mind- blowing.\nIn yet another study, we presented two pictures to Paul, each po -\nsitioned on diff  er ent sides of  the screen, and instructed him to \npoint to the picture that matched what he saw.

Our conversa -\ntion led us to the idea that we all spin tales or narratives to make \nsense of ourselves and our world, a notion that would figure prom -\ninently in our 1978 book The Integrated Mind.\nEver since my studies of Paul, I have been fascinated with ques -\ntions about how our conscious experiences come about in the brain, \nespecially in relation to emotions and memory, and have summa -\nrized updates of my views in my books over the years.

It raises questions about the value of ancient, entrenched \nnotions of self and person  as ways to define what and who we are. I \nreconceptualize the useful information obtained by empirical re -\nsearch on  these topics and place it in a new framework, one based \nmore on scientific rather than philosophical princi ples. In par  tic-\nu lar, I argue that every thing about what it is to be a  human being \ncan be understood in terms of our biological, neurobiological, cog -\nnitive, and conscious realms of existence.  These make us biological \nbeings with ner  vous systems that can think, plan, and decide, and \nthat can experience our inner thoughts and feelings.\nThe next four parts of  the book delve deeply into  these realms. \nI start by describing how all organisms exist biologically, but some \nof  these (namely animals) have a ner  vous system and exist neuro -\nbiologically.

This way of  thinking began to take shape in \nthe seventeenth  century through the writings of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. \nA polymath, Descartes was a phi los o pher, mathematician, and phys -\nicist, and if psy chol ogy and neuroscience had existed, he undoubt -\nedly would have excelled in  those areas, too.\nDescartes viewed the mind as an immaterial, immortal soul. It \nwas both spiritual (connected to God) and  mental (the locus of  \nthought, including conscious thoughts about oneself). With his fa -\nmous statement cogito, ergo sum  (I think, therefore, I am), he tied \npersonal existence to conscious thought, and equated this conscious -\nness with the soul. In his scheme, the conscious mind has agency\u2014 \nthat is, it controls the actions of its physical body, and as a result, \n will be held accountable on  Judgment Day. Other animals exist only \nbodily and, lacking conscious agency, have no afterlife in  either \nheaven or hell.\nJohn Locke, who followed Descartes by a few de cades, rocked \nthe Christian world when he proposed that the core of an individual \nwas not an immaterial soul but a conscious self  that persisted over \ntime. Key to Locke\u2019s position was his novel solution to the prob  lem \nof how one knows they are the same person  today as yesterday. In \n England, where Locke resided, identity was based on social status. \nBut Locke said it instead resulted from the continuity of one\u2019s self \nover time. This was achieved, he proposed, by thinking back to the \npast\u2014 that is, by making one\u2019s self, via conscious memory, the same \nself now as it was then.\nLocke also introduced the idea of a constitution of man,  which he \nsaid encompasses our body, and all our behavioral and  mental fac -\nulties.

The moralist Bishop Butler, for example, talked \nabout two kinds of selves\u2014 one cool and settled (a feeling of  the \nmoment) and the other passionate and / or sensual (a feeling of self- \ninterest). Along similar divisional lines, the phi los o pher Adam Smith, \nknown as the  father of modern economics, described how he \nexamined his own conduct: \u201cI divide myself, as it  were, into two \npersons.\u201d  These he referred to as the examiner and the judge. He also \ntook the self into the social realm, viewing one\u2019s relationship to  others \nas a function of one\u2019s relationship to one\u2019s self.  Later, Alexander \nBain noted that we look at our thoughts with a \u201cwarm eye,\u201d with a \n\u201ctenderness for that activity\u201d as if it was another person.\nButler also introduced a notion of  the self as the core of a moni -\ntoring system that maintains the normalcy of  human nature (an idea \nthat has become popu lar  today in cognitive science). Deviance, in -\ncluding  mental illness and criminality, then came to be thought of \nas a failure to monitor and was thus a weakness of  the self.\nBy the eigh teenth  century, the vocabulary of self had proliferated \nin everyday language with the use of  terms like self- worth, self-  \nesteem, self- conscious, self- love, self- praise, self- pride, self- contained, \nself- regard, self- made, self- interest, self- confidence, self- aware, self-  \nmonitoring, self- involved, self- care, and selfish.

This idea planted the seed that the con -\nscious self might be the subject of scientific inquiry.\nBut it was not  until the late nineteenth  century that a scientific \nendeavor emerged that could pursue such an idea. It was then, in \nGermany, that the methods of natu ral science, notably physiology, \nbegan to be applied to the philosophical prob  lems of  the mind, and \nespecially to consciousness. The result was the field of experimental \npsy chol ogy.\nThe main approach taken by  these scientific psychologists was the \nsame one that phi los o phers had relied on in their analyses of \nconsciousness\u2014 introspection. What the German psychologists \nadded was a way to treat the results of self- introspections as scientific \ndata with strict rules for both how to go about the introspective pro -\ncess and how to rec ord the observations.\nIn the United States, one of  the early pioneers of  the new psy-\nchol ogy was William  James.

But it was not the \nsame self- conscious mind that the forefathers of psy chol ogy had been \nconcerned with. The cognitive mind was, instead, portrayed as an \ninformation pro cessing system, rather than a system that makes sub -\njective experiences. It was in a sense unconscious, but not in the deep \nFreudian sense. The unconscious aspects of cognition  were mostly \nframed as pro cesses that support mind and be hav ior  behind the scenes \nwithout explicit conscious content\u2014 processes that create repre sen-\nta tions by manipulating symbols. Cognitive science was not anti-  \nconscious, but it was disinclined to investigate it, since so much could \nbe explained without making recourse to consciousness. Over time, \nas behaviorism receded in psy chol ogy, consciousness, including the \nconscious self, slowly began to make its way back.\n These days, the seventeenth- century Western philosophical fu -\nsion of self and consciousness, which objectified the self as a natu ral \nentity of  the physical world, is alive and well. This is why we think \nof who we are as an individual in terms of  the word self. It is why we \ntreat our self as an entity with properties and call on this entity to \nexplain our thoughts and actions.

Because the self is itself just an idea.\nI am hardly the first to critique the idea of  the self as a real entity. \nShortly  after Locke\u2019s time, the phi los o pher David Hume referred to \nthe self as \u201cthe elusive \u2018I\u2019 that shows an alarming tendency to dis appear \nwhen we try to introspect it.\u201d With the rise of scientific psychology, \nthe value of \u201cself\u201d as a topic was heatedly debated. More recently, but \nin a similar vein, the phi los o pher Daniel Dennett and  others have de -\nscribed the self as illusory. Some have noted that discussions about the \nself are  really discussions about other  things; the self is a gratuitous no -\ntion. I think Thomas Metzinger truly hit the nail on its head when \nhe said that \u201cnobody ever had or was a self.\u201d A similar perspective has \nrecently been offered by the psychologist Zolt\u00e1n Dienes.\nAnother obvious prob  lem with the traditional notion of  the self \nis that it remains a narrowly focused conception promoted by Eu-\nro pean phi los o phers and imported into modern psy chol ogy and \nneuroscience. Cultural traditions that treat the self and other aspects \nof  human existence differently have received less attention.\nEfforts have been made to get around the vari ous critiques. The \nphi los o pher Shaun Gallagher pointed out that a common strategy is \nto avoid directly focusing on the self  by modifying it with other \nterms. Examples include the conscious, unconscious, core, autobio -\ngraphical, narrative, existential, social, embodied, and synaptic self.\nSimilarly, the psychologist Ulric Neisser suggested a focus on as-\npects of the self, as opposed to the self itself.

Weak emergence \nis descriptive\u2014in this version, the self is simply a word that sum -\nmarizes the combined effect of all the under lying phenomena that \nhave been discovered about the self.

He used questionnaires to collect data \nabout  people\u2019s backgrounds and be hav ior, and applied statistical anal -\nyses to make sense of  the results. He also introduced the use of \ncommon- language words about mind and be hav ior to label his \nbottom-up statistical findings about personality. Greatly influenced \nby Darwin, Galton believed that  human physical and  mental capaci -\nties  were inherited traits, and was among  those who embraced eu -\ngenics to improve the quality of  human genes by excluding from \nsociety  those thought to be inferior.\nDespite the stain of eugenics, the trait approach was reinvigorated \nin the twentieth  century by Gordon Allport. Early in his  career All -\nport visited Freud and left feeling that to understand personality he \nneeded to focus on  factors more obvious than  those hidden in the \ndepths of  the unconscious. Like Galton, he took a bottom-up ap -\nproach, compiling a list of more than four thousand words related \nto what a person is. Raymond Cattell also applied statistical analyses \nof  people\u2019s self- reported responses to questionnaires. He whittled \ndown Allport\u2019s much longer list to just sixteen words.\nCurrently, the so- called big five model is the most widely ac -\ncepted trait scheme.

Both genes and experience are thought to affect the big-  five \ntraits.\nTrait theory has its critics.

He used the word pneuma  (from the Greek, meaning breath) \nto account for Aristotle\u2019s soul idea. According to Galen, pneuma, \nbreathed into the body by the lungs, is transported throughout the \nbody, giving it life.\nDuring Galen\u2019s time, Chris tian ity was growing in popularity in \nthe Roman Empire, and his Aristotelian view of life, with a soul or \nspirit in the body, was transformed into the Christian notion of an \neternal soul that was separate from the body. For the next thousand \nyears, the Church dominated life in the empire, which had spread \nacross what would be come to be called Eu rope.

In eukaryotic cells, metabolism is the job of  tiny \nenergy machines called mitochondria. Each cell in the body makes \nits own energy by using oxygen to break down glucose. T o achieve \nthis outcome, the fluids surrounding the cells must have a suitable \nconcentration supply of glucose and oxygen, as well as ions (cal -\ncium, potassium, sodium), minerals (iron, magnesium), and a proper \npH (acid- base balance).  These chemicals are delivered throughout \nthe body via the bloodstream. Blood flow requires that the heart be \nbeating.

Some terms come right out the vitalist tradition ( vis \nessentialis, vis vitalis,  \u00e9lan vital,  vital impetus, life force, life spirit), and \n others are associated with Greek philosophy, Chris tian ity (soul, \nspirit), or Eastern spiritualism (chi, brio, ki, prana, shakti, purusha, \nj\u014driki, astral body).\nBelief in a soul or afterlife, or in spiritualism in general,  will prob-\nably always exist among  humans.

Scholars have long understood that \nanimals exist in diff  er ent ways si mul ta neously. For example, as I ex -\nplained  earlier, Aristotle said that animals exist both vegetatively \nand amatively\u2014 with vegetative functions being about the inner \nbody and animative function being about interactions with the outer \nworld.\nBuilding on this distinction, Bichat, the eighteenth- century tissue \nphysiologist (and vitalist), proposed a similar duality of animal exis -\ntence. According to his view, animals, through their so- called veg -\netative inner tissues, live a vie de nutrition  (life of nutrition) and \nthrough their sensory and motor tissues, a vie de relation  (a life of  \nbehavioral interactions with the world). Bernard expanded on Bi -\nchat, proposing internal and external milieus, and Cannon added \nhomeostasis as the way the inner and outer worlds are kept in bal -\nance. By contrast with Descartes\u2019s philosophical separation of a phys -\nical (biological) body from a non- physical mind, the diff  er ent kinds \nof animal existence just mentioned  were simply biological.\n There\u2019s no shortage of material on this topic.

But  there\u2019s a \npar tic u lar perspective on this duality of animal life that had a major \nimpact on how this book unfolded.\nRomer\u2019s Body Duality\nEarly on in writing this book, I stumbled across an article by the \npaleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer that was initially published \nin the 1950s, then re- published in the 1970s in a book on evolu -\ntionary biology. It escaped my notice, and, as far as I can tell, that \nof most neuroscientists, for the next forty- eight years.\nIt\u2019s not that Romer himself  was overlooked. He was widely rec -\nognized for his work on the anatomical changes required for evo -\nlutionary transition from fish to amphibians, and has been described \nas one of  the impor  tant evolutionary anatomists of  the twentieth \n century. His 1955 textbook, The Vertebrate Body,  is considered the \nbible of comparative anatomy. Y et the par  tic u lar paper in question \nseems to have seldom been cited in the mainstream lit er a ture on \nbrain anatomy, and citations that did occur  were mostly in technical \npapers on very specific topics. For me, though, it ended up be -\ncoming a crucial part of my conception of  this book.\nI have to admit, it took several readings. At first it seemed like a \nstraightforward reworking of  the ideas of  Aristotle, Bichat, Bernard, \nand Cannon. But the more I delved into to Romer, the more in-\nter est ing I found what he had to say.\nRomer focused on two classes of muscle tissues known to be pos -\nsessed by vertebrates. Striated muscles make up much of  the body\u2019s \nflesh and are attached to the skeleton.  These respond rapidly in con -\ntrolling body movements in the external world, and they underlie \nbe hav ior. Smooth muscles, by contrast, are traditionally associated \nwith inner organs and glands that take care of digestive, respiratory, \nreproductive, and other physiological functions.

The mix of   these \nproteins in striated muscles underlies their contractile efficiency, and \nthe way the proteins are arranged gives the appearance of vis i ble \nbands, striations, that are the basis for their name.\nBut Romer noted that the association of striated muscles with \nskeletal movement and smooth muscles with the inner tissues was \nan oversimplification. In par  tic u lar, in some vertebrates, some \nsmooth muscles have striations. While the existence of   these hy -\nbrid (striated / smooth) muscles was known for some time, it was \ntreated as a minor anomaly. Romer, however, saw a significant evo -\nlutionary pro cess at work.\nLike Bernard, Romer built on the importance of  the vertebrate \ntransition from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle. He proposed that \nin order to meet the metabolic challenges imposed by the new en -\nvironment, early amphibians needed more efficient muscles in the \nheart, lungs, and digestive track. This led to the addition of rapidly \ncontracting proteins in some smooth muscles, which gave  those \nmuscles striations similar to skeletal muscles.\nRomer concluded that since the presence of striations is not \n limited to muscles that move the skeleton in space, the way to think \nabout the relation of muscles to body function is not in terms of  \nthe distinction between striated and smooth categories. Instead, he \nsaid, the key distinction is between somatic (behavioral) and visceral \n(so- called vegetative) body systems, regardless of  the muscles  those \nsystems use. The implications of Romer\u2019s conclusion are perhaps \nbest left to his own words:\nIn many regards the vertebrate organism,  whether fish or \nmammal, is a well- knit unit structure.

The secretory tissues that re -\nlease hormones and fluids are the second (adrenal medulla, adrenal \ncortex, pancreas, gonads, thyroid, parathyroid, pineal, salivary, lac -\nrimal, and sweat glands).

A prime example is habituation. For example, if  the \ndome of a jellyfish is touched repeatedly, it habituates (stops con -\ntracting its escape muscles). Another kind of non- associative learning \nis sensitization. With sensitization,  after strong stimulation on one \npart of  the jellyfish body, a weak stimulus on another part of  the \nbody elicits a strong response. Unlike in associative learning, the two \nstimuli never occur together\u2014 the strong stimulus just primes the \nbody to respond to the weaker one.\nGinsburg and  Jablonka\u2019s suggestion that associative learning \nevolved by small modifications of an existing memory mechanisms \nwas about non- associative learning.

They  were active \npredators. Absent a moveable jaw, they filtered food through their \nstationary teeth. Present- day examples are lamprey and hagfish. Fish \nwith bones and moveable jaws, which include most of  the fish \nwe eat, came  later in the Cambrian, and diversified quickly during \nthat time.\nThe first non- aquatic (non- fish) vertebrates appeared about 350 \nmillion years ago. This happened when fishapods,  which  were a tran -\nsition animal between fish and amphibians, adapted to a terrestrial \nexistence by converting fins into stilt- like legs. The abundance of \nvegetation on land provided a food source. But as part of  their res -\npiration, plants also provided oxygen, which is a necessary ingre -\ndient for animal respiration and metabolism. Fishapods, in addition \nto being able to walk on all fours, also acquired other adaptations \nuseful for terrestrial locomotion, including the ability to see on land \nas well as underwater. Nevertheless, they could not stray far from \n water since, like their fish ancestors, their eggs  were fertilized ex -\nternally, which required  water or moist soil. Although fishapods\u2019 \nterrestrial vision was  limited, it paved the way for distal vision in \namniotes.\nAmniotes  (named for the amnion, an internal compartment for \nhosting the embryo) arrived about 310 million years ago.

A second line of \ndescent started, too. From it therapsids,  another amniote, evolved. \nMammals, a subgroup of  therapsids, diverged  later.\nThe legs of  the early amniote common ancestor of reptiles and \ntherapsids hung from its sides. Reptiles retained this body plan, but \ntherapsids came up with something diff  er ent: legs directly under-\nneath the body trunk.  Because of  this arrangement they  were able to \nbreathe and run at the same time when escaping predators or cap -\nturing prey. This was a tremendous advantage, but demanded a lot of \nenergy, and so required them to consume more food and use more \noxygen than reptiles. The resulting higher metabolic rates produced \nbody heat, which allowed therapsids to maintain an internal body \ntemperature through metabolism. In other words, they  were endo -\nthermic (warm- blooded). And they had a visual system that allowed \nthem to see well and forage during daytime or at night. Reptiles, \nbeing cold- blooded, had to heat their bodies externally during day -\nlight; at night they  were sessile in order to conserve heat.\nA mass extinction about 250 million years ago wiped out much \nof animal and plant life.

Slowly, cynodonts gave up \ndaytime foraging and the visual capacities that support it, and instead \nled nocturnal lives. Mammals evolved from  these nocturnal cynodonts \nabout 210 million years ago.\nEarly mammals, like their cynodont ancestors, had small bodies \nand  were nocturnal.

This, he said, allowed mammals to use feelings to \nflexibly control be hav ior, freeing them from the rigid instinctual \nheritage of reptiles. The limbic system included subcortical forebrain \nareas such as the amygdala and cortical areas such as the hippo -\ncampus, cingulate gyrus, and orbital region. What tied  these areas \ntogether, in his view, was connectivity with the hypothalamus.  These \nconnections, in turn, he said, made it pos si ble for emotions to con -\ntrol survival be hav iors and the visceral responses of  the body that \nsupport  those be hav iors.\nThe limbic cortical areas are all located medially in the brains of \nall mammals\u2014 with the allocortex in the medial temporal lobe and \nthe meso- cortex in the medial frontal lobe. Imagine the hemi spheres \nof the brain as a hotdog bun. The white part, vis i ble only when \nthe bun is pulled apart, is analogous to the limbic cortical areas. \nThe brown outer part of  the hotdog bun is like the neocortex in the \nlateral parts of  the hemi spheres. In early mammals, the neocortex \nconsisted mainly of  the sensory and motor cortex, and was primarily \nused for controlling be hav ior in responses to sensory stimuli.  These \nforebrain areas expanded in size and complexity in primates. In ad -\ndition, primates added new areas of neocortex that engaged in the \ncomplex integration of sensory information across modalities in \nthe temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. This so- called multimodal \nassociative cortex  allowed primates to reach new heights in cogni -\ntion, and in  humans, language- based cognition.\nSummarizing this triune brain, MacLean noted:\nMan, it appears, has inherited essentially three brains.

The axons of   these \nganglia cause the tissues to respond by contraction or relaxation, \nor, in the case of endocrine glands, to release hormones into the \nbloodstream.\nLangley conceived of  the ANS as having two components that \nwork in opposition. The sympathetic ner  vous system,  he said, is prewired \nwith innate discharge patterns that are sufficient to control the physi -\nological functions of  the viscera. The parasympathetic system,  by con -\ntrast, was said to operate alongside the sympathetic system (hence the \ndesignation para), and counteract the sympathetic system\u2019s effects and \nrestore equilibrium. Both systems  were believed to affect all visceral \norgans and glands in a singular, all or nothing, reflexive fashion.\nA key feature of  the somatic ner  vous system is that it has sensory \nand motor components. For example, if you touch a hot stove, sen -\nsory messages travel to the spinal cord and automatically cause your \nhand to withdraw. But ANS ganglia, especially the sympathetic gan -\nglia, control visceral responses without the benefit of sensations \nfrom the viscera. For this reason, Langley viewed the ANS as a motor \nsystem.\nWhile Langley\u2019s terminology is still used  today, our con temporary \nunderstanding has led to several major revisions. For example, it is no \nlonger accepted that the two components each respond in an all- or- \nnothing way, affecting all visceral tissues similarly. Instead, it is thought \nthat diff  er ent situations elicit subtly diff  er ent patterns of activation of  \nthe visceral organs by each part of  the ANS. And the parasympathetic \ncomponent, which was often treated as secondary to the sympathetic \nsystem, is no longer seen as a mere counterforce to sympathetic re -\nsponses. Moreover, the ANS is no longer viewed as simply a motor \nsystem. Instead, visceral tissues respond to mechanical pressure and \nchemical stimuli (oxygen or carbon dioxide).

The neurobiologist William Blessing, for example, \nhas forcefully argued that the concept of  the ANS has outlived its \nusefulness. Nevertheless, the ANS, like the limbic system and triune \nbrain, lives on, despite such scientific challenges.\nWhile the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of  the \nANS have historically received most of  the attention, a third part \nalso exists. This enteric ner  vous system  consists of millions of neurons \nthat are associated with the digestive tract, but also with cardiac and \nsome other visceral tissues. In the late twentieth  century it gained \nscientific attention, and was nicknamed the gut brain,  which gar -\nnered it a place in the public imagination.

First, as we just saw, the parasympa -\nthetic vagus nerve sends signals to the hindbrain about the state of  \nthe body. Langley knew this but downplayed it. Second, visceral sen -\nsations in the hindbrain clearly connect with the midbrain and fore -\nbrain.

His logic:  because \ncontrol of  the ANS is automatic (unconscious and non- volitional), \nit must take place totally in the periphery and brainstem, not the \nforebrain.

During the early twentieth \n century, German researchers reported that electrical stimulation \nof the subcortical forebrain, especially the hypothalamus, elicited \nchanges in cardiovascular and other visceral activities.

More \nrecent work has shown that the amygdala and some other limbic \nregions (including several relatively primitive areas of medial meso-  \ncortical prefrontal cortex, such as the prelimbic, orbital, anterior \n cingulate and insula cortex) also have direct connections with mid -\nbrain and hindbrain areas that control sympathetic and parasympa -\nthetic activities.\nIt\u2019s worth pausing  here to note that subcortical brain areas like \nthe amygdala, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia have subdivisions that \nhave functional roles.

As sensory connections develop, they begin \nto transmit some sensation prenatally (for example, sounds from the \nouter world).\nAn animal\u2019s experiences with its sensory world  after birth are also \na crucial  factor in creating the synaptic connections that make its \nsensory systems function properly. For example, studies conducted \nin the 1960s by David Hubel and T orsten Wiesel showed that sur -\ngical closure of one eye of an animal shortly  after birth prevented \ncells in the visual areas in the neocortex from having the proper \ninputs from that eye. This led to prob  lems in depth perception, \nwhich requires integration of inputs from both eyes. If  the eye was \nsurgically closed during a narrow time period early in life, the so- \ncalled critical period, the effects  were lifelong, whereas if  the eye \nwas closed  after that period, the effects  were only temporary.

There are, of course, differences in complexity, but they are \nmostly variations on a common theme.\nReflexes\nReflexes, as noted  earlier, are innate motor programs that are genet-\nically preordained to be activated by specific stimuli.  These motor \nprograms are mostly built into cir  cuits in the spinal cord, and / or the \nbrainstem. Peripheral sensory nerves bring sensory information into \nthe CNS motor program from peripheral receptors, and peripheral \nmotor nerves connect the CNS cir  cuits to the muscles. Although no \nbe hav ior is strictly inborn or strictly due to learning, some, like re -\nflexes, are more innate than  others. As with visceral reflexes, somatic \nreflexes can be modulated by higher levels of control in the forebrain.\nA given reflex typically engages a  limited set of specific muscles. \nBut in complex be hav iors, multiple reflexes are often engaged si mul-\nta neously. For example, walking is a voluntary, often goal- directed, \nactivity, but under lying the act itself are numerous reflexes that con -\ntrol the coordinated movement of one\u2019s two legs and arms, all while \nmaintaining balance and posture. The basic coordination pro cesses \nbegin to unfold in early life  under the direction of a developmental \nge ne tic program, but much trial- and- error learning is also required \nfor the activity to become second nature. Once learned, movements \nlike this, which involve precisely timed contractions and relaxations \nof many muscles throughout the body, depend on cir  cuits in the \ncerebellum region of  the hindbrain. We know this in part  because \nwhen the cerebellum is damaged, the person suffers devastating \nlosses of control over their movements.\nAlthough animals are born prewired with basic stimulus- response \nreflex connections, other reflexes can be acquired through Pavlovian \nassociative learning.

The cat became \nvery animated, making random movements. Over time the cat \nlearned, through trial and error, that when it behaved in a par  tic-\nu lar way, the door would open. From that point on, the animal re -\npeated the be hav ior when it was again in that situation. Thorndike \ncalled  these instrumental be hav iors  because they achieved something \nfor the organism\u2014 they provided some degree of mastery over an \nenvironmental situation.\nLike Pavlovian associative conditioning of reflexes and species- \ntypical action patterns, habits are automatically elicited by stimuli. \nBut the two pro cesses also differ. Pavlovian conditioning is about \nhow a reinforcer (like food) enables a novel stimulus (for example, \na tone) to control an innate response (to approach and consume the \nfood). Habit learning, instead, involves acquiring a new be hav ior \n(such as learning how to open a locked door so that food can be \napproached and consumed). And in terms of learning, Pavlovian \nconditioning involves stimulus- stimulus associations (between a neu -\ntral sensory stimulus and a reinforcer), while in habits the rein -\nforcer establishes stimulus- response associations.\nThe stamping-in of a stimulus- response habit requires integration \nin the brain of information about the stimulus situation with infor -\nmation about the response. In all vertebrates, from fish to  humans, \nthe key stimulus- response convergence takes place in the basal gan -\nglia, which, as I noted  earlier, is a collection of subcortical ce re bral \nnuclei that play an impor  tant role in the control of movements.\nThe basal ganglia are reciprocally connected with cortical areas, \nincluding the sensory and motor cortex, which provide it with stim -\nulus and response information.

When the cat was again in that (or \na similar) stimulus situation, the habitual response was automati -\ncally elicited.\nAs mentioned  earlier, it has been proposed that instrumental \nlearning evolved in the Cambrian era by modifying the dopamine \nregulation of locomotor cir  cuits in area- restricted foraging, and by \nintegrating this mechanism with associative learning. Indeed, it is \nknown that animals learn habitual responses as they move around \nin search of food. When food is found in a par  tic u lar location, stimuli \nthat identify that location are stamped in by the payoff. But being \nable to find that location again requires some understanding of  the \nrelationship of  that location to other locations in the foraging area.\nAlthough MacLean had made the hippocampus the centerpiece \nof his emotional limbic system,  these days the hippocampus is known \nfor its role in creating spatial maps of  the environment, remembering \nthem, and using them in foraging. In par  tic u lar, the hippocampus is \nconnected with sensory areas of  the neocortex and the dorsal lateral \nstriatal habit cir  cuit, and, from vertebrates\u2019 earliest days,  these areas \nhave been involved in stimulus- response learning during foraging.\nHabits may seem  simple, but they are not.

The chunked action sequences \nof habits in fact are a very impor  tant part of learned skills. But  there \nis a key difference.

He also pointed out that much of  the \nunder lying pro cessing takes place unconsciously. This helped set the \nstage for a new science of mind, a cognitive psy chol ogy, that was not \nsolely about consciousness. Lashley additionally noted that language \nmust be factored into the explanation of  human be hav ior, implying \nthat  there are limits to what can be learned from animals.\nMeanwhile in Canada, Donald Hebb, a professor at McGill Uni -\nversity, published in 1949 the influential book The Organ ization of \nBe hav ior,  which broke with behaviorism.

B.\u00a0F . Skinner, in true behaviorist \nform, said that  children acquire language by the differential rein -\nforcement of verbal be hav ior,  much like other animals learn their be-\nhav iors. The linguist Noam Chomsky, by contrast, argued that \nlanguage emerges from an internal  mental structure, a generative \ngrammar that is unique to  humans and that underlies all  human \nmentation. Around the same time  Jerome Bruner published a book \ncalled The Study of Thinking.  He argued that concept formation \noccurs not by way of strings of associations, but instead as a  mental \npro cess.\nAlso in the 1950s, around the same time as surgery on HM, the \npsycholinguist George Miller, who had leaned  toward behaviorism \nearly in his  career, offered another significant challenge to stimulus-  \nresponse psy chol ogy. This tran spired in a famous paper on short- \nterm memory titled \u201cThe Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus \nT wo: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Pro cessing Information.\u201d \nIn it, Miller showed that  people can hold in mind  (that is, in short- \nterm memory) roughly seven items in the pro cess of  thinking and \nreasoning about the world. This was radical  because behaviorists \ntalked about learning, not memory. Miller went on to suggest that \nthe fixed  mental limit of short- term memory is easily circumvented \nby cognitive strategies such as chunking,  in which information is bun -\ndled or grouped by recoding the information. For example, a typ -\nical phone number in the United States is ten digits long. It is easier \nto remember such a number by separating the ten items into three \ngroups (area code, exchange, and number).

Several de cades  later, cognitive psychologists \ndisplaced behaviorism, but not by making consciousness their \nmain subject. They  rose to the top by taking a smaller step away \nfrom behaviorism, emphasizing information pro cessing rather than \nconsciousness.\nSpecifically, early cognitive enthusiasts, inspired by similarities be -\ntween computers and minds, focused on how information pro cessing \nmight create internal repre sen ta tions of  the world that could be \nused in thinking and behavioral control.

But if \nsomeone asks you a question while you are rehearsing it, storage of  \nthe memory  will be disrupted and you  will likely forget the number.\nEarly theories emphasized covert verbal rehearsal as a maintenance \nmechanism.  Because rehearsal mainly works for verbal information, \nanother pro cess called attention- refreshing  is thought to be impor  tant \n because it can be used to maintain any kind of information. Al -\nthough temporary storage of information was originally assumed \nto be a function of  the central executive,  these days vari ous special -\nized systems (especially sensory and memory systems) are viewed as \nprimary loci of  temporary storage.\nJoaquin Fuster, a leading researcher, pointed out the breadth of  \nworking memory content, explaining that it \u201ccan be sensory, motor, \nor mixed; it may consist of reactivated perceptual memory or the \nmotor memory of  the act to be performed, or both.

And it cannot \ndo this without long- term memory, and especially schema.\nThe contribution of long- term memory to working memory was \nnicely described by Steven Kosslyn, who said that working memory \nfunctions \u201crequire not only some form of  temporary storage, but \nalso an interplay between information that is stored temporarily and \na larger body of stored knowledge.\u201d This body of stored knowledge \nis called semantic memory. We use working- memory executive \nfunctions to retrieve semantic memories as we try to understand sit -\nuations and make decisions about them.\nSemantic memories are about facts, such as what apples are, or \nwhere Italy is located in the world. By interacting as schema, they \nhelp us meaningfully conceptualize and categorize the objects and \nsituations in which we find ourselves. Semantic memories also un -\nderlie the flexible use of language to express meanings non- literally, \nsuch as when we combine concepts to communicate meta phor ically. \nScience, art,  music, religion, politics, society, and culture are based \non factual and conceptual semantic knowledge.\nThe Dual- System / Dual- Process Approach  \nto  Human Cognition\nCon temporary cognitive theories often draw on the difference be -\ntween intuitions and deliberations.

It also \nlearns associations. Kahneman\u2019s System 2, by contrast, allocates at -\ntention to activities that require  mental work, and its functions are \nclosely associated with agency, choice, concentration, and conscious \nexperience.\nA defining feature of System 2 deliberation is that it depends on \nworking memory. Unlike intuition, it uses the deliberative powers \nof working memory to explore alternative decisions and actions. \nThe downside is that deliberation is computationally and energeti -\ncally expensive.

While new research was \ncontinuing to support the idea that cognition contributed to asso -\nciative learning in non- human primates and rodents,  these results \n were often quickly followed by studies showing that a stimulus-  \nresponse explanation was just as good or better. Consequently, many \nanimal psychologists remained committed to behaviorist princi  ples \nand continued to reject the idea that some animals in some circum -\nstances are cognitive creatures that pursue goals.\nIn the late 1970s T olman\u2019s ideas  were dusted off and put in the \nspotlight by  John O\u2019Keefe and Lynn Nadel in their book The Hip -\npocampus as a Cognitive Map.

The next year, Craik was appointed the inaugural director \nof the Applied Psy chol ogy Unit at Cambridge University, a group \nestablished to use engineering and psychological expertise to de -\nvelop technologies that would support the British effort in World \nWar II.  Just one year  later, at the age of  thirty- one, he died from \ninjuries sustained in a bicycle accident.\nCraik\u2019s line of succession would define major landmarks in the \nmodern history of cognitive science. Upon Craik\u2019s death, his col -\nleague at Cambridge, Frederic Bartlett, took over the unit. This was \nfitting since Craik\u2019s mental- model theory had been influenced by \nBartlett\u2019s ideas about the role of schemas in thought and action. \nThen some three de cades  later, in 1973, Alan Baddeley became di -\nrector of  the Applied Psy chol ogy Unit, publishing in the same year \nhis first paper on working memory.

For example, he noted that the mental- model theory \nassumes that the more information one needs to make an infer -\nence, the more difficult it should be to draw that inference. And \n because working memory, as we have seen, has a  limited capacity, \nwe often use only a subset of  the knowledge available to reach \nconclusions. Consequently, inferences based on  mental models \ncan be very useful, but also faulty.\nAs an example of how  mental models contribute to reasoning, \nconsider the assertion \u201cAll artists are bakers.\u201d  Johnson- Laird pointed \nout that this assertion implies the existence of a  mental model rep -\nresenting the relation between the two sets of individuals. The holder \nof this model thus can infer that if someone is an artist, they are also \na baker.

By 1.5 million years ago, fire was controlled \nand food, especially meat, began to be cooked.\nIn emphasizing the role of foraging in the evolution of cogni -\ntion, I have focused on how ecological  factors, such as scarcity and \nrisk in finding food,  shaped the development of mammalian cogni -\ntion. Another set of impor  tant  factors that influenced cognitive \nevolution in  humans was social in nature, and included coopera -\ntion, communication and language, theory of mind (the ability to \nmake assumptions about the minds of  others based on knowledge \nabout how one\u2019s own mind works), and cultural transmission of \nknowledge.\nFor example, having a theory of mind may have allowed hunters \nseparated in space to create  mental models in which they could \nanticipate what each was likely to do as the hunt progressed, and \nverbal communication would have allowed the day\u2019s successes and \nfailures to be shared and stored as memories that could be incorpo -\nrated into the  mental model of  the hunt and enhance the proba -\nbility of success on the next excursion. By the same token, foraging \nenhancements, such as tool use, likely led to efficiencies in finding \nfood, which may have made more time available for social sharing of \ninformation and social bonding in less transactional ways.\nThis is not to say that social  factors had no effect on other pri -\nmates.

For example, the striatum of pre-  \nmammalian vertebrates consisted of just two main regions: the \ndorsal and ventral striata. In mammals,  these striatal regions increased \nin size and expanded into distinct functional subareas.

One of  the key forebrain \nchanges in mammals may, therefore, have been the splitting of  the \ndorsal striatum to include separate lateral and medial parts. The lat -\neral part retained the classic striatal role in instrumental habit \nlearning, and the medial part came to be a central component of  \nthe goal- directed be hav ior circuitry. This segregation is what allows \nmammals to behave rigidly, with habits, in response to stimuli \nlearned about in the past, or flexibly in a goal- directed fashion in \nnovel situations. Their ability to choose  whether to behave habitu -\nally or flexibly was a tremendous advantage for mammals trying to \nkeep their warm- blooded bodies well fed and regulated, what ever \nthe environmental conditions.\nLike the habit cir  cuit centered on the lateral part of  the dorsal \nstriatum, the goal- directed cir  cuit centered on the medial part is re -\nciprocally connected with sensory and motor areas of  the neocortex \nand receives inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons. But the goal-  \ndirected circuitry is considerably more complex (Figure\u00a019.1). For \none  thing, in addition to connections with the sensory- motor \ncortex, it is interconnected with the prelimbic region of medial \nprefrontal cortex.

After a \ndelay, the screen was raised, and the monkey could uncover the treat \nand eat it. Regardless of   whether the delay was a few seconds or \nseveral minutes, monkeys without damage to the PFC had no \ntrou ble remembering which object the treat was located  under. \n Those with prefrontal damage also performed well with short de -\nlays, but  were impaired when longer delays  were used.  Jacobsen de -\nscribed the results by noting that the monkeys with granular PFC \ndamage  were unable to hold information in temporary memory for \nthe purpose of solving the prob  lem; instead they could use past \nlearning of  what objects are, as well as learned habits.\nJacobsen\u2019s studies  were the beginning of a long line of research \non the role of granular PFC in what we now know as working \nmemory. Particularly impor  tant studies in the 1950s by Mortimer \nMishkin and Karl Pribram found that the dorsolateral PFC is the \narea of granular PFC that underlies the monkeys\u2019 temporary memory \nwhile they perform the delayed response task.

This suggested a mechanism by which in -\nformation might be held in mind by working- memory pro cesses \nwhile the monkey decides how to respond.\nThe dorsolateral PFC is one component of  the lateral PFC,  which \nalso includes the ventrolateral PFC. It is now known that both of  \n these areas contribute to working memory. A third component of  \nthe lateral PFC is the lateral orbital PFC, which contributes to \nworking memory in tasks where the value of  the stimulus is an \nimpor  tant  factor. T o keep  things  simple, I  will mostly use the broader \nterm lateral PFC, rather than the specific subarea terms, when de -\nscribing the working memory mechanism.\nThe contribution of  the lateral PFC to working memory in de -\nlayed response tasks is illuminated by the fact that it receives inputs \nfrom sensory areas of  the neocortex. For example, the visual cortex \nconnects with the lateral PFC via two pathways. One connects the \nvisual cortex to temporal lobe cir  cuits that support object recogni -\ntion, and the other connects it to the parietal lobe cir  cuits that un -\nderlie the control of action in relation to external space.  These two \nvisual streams converge in the lateral PFC and help bind distinct \nfeatures (what and where) into complex perceptions that then con -\ntrol actions.\nThe lateral PFC integrates sensory information not only within \na single modality, but also between modalities (Figure\u00a019.3). It is \ntherefore referred to as a convergence zone  that can form modality- \nindependent repre sen ta tions and allows a monkey or  human to \n\u201cknow\u201d what something is by the way it looks, smells, sounds, feels \nand / or tastes.

This led Bradley \nPostle to suggest that working memory is not simply localized to \nthe lateral PFC, but instead involves a co ali tion of areas that are con -\ntrolled by executive functions of  the lateral PFC. Postle summa -\nrized several specific kinds of interactions between the lateral PFC \nand other areas that underlie decision- making during the delay pe -\nriod, including monitoring, attending, selecting information, and \nevaluating expectations about needs, desires, and goals.\nEarl Miller and colleagues have evaluated the cellular basis of such \npro cesses, and showed that neurons in specific cell layers of  the lat -\neral granular PFC exercise top- down executive control over poste -\nrior sensory and memory pro cess, regulating their se lection for entry \ninto working memory.\nNote that the lateral PFC is not the exclusive home of executive \nfunctions such as attention.

This argument, however, is problematic.

He describes this quality as a phenomenal \nfeeling \u2014 the  thing that makes red seem red, and fear feel fearful. \nTherefore conscious states feel like something, whereas unconscious \nstates are accompanied by no such feeling. But why do conscious \n mental states have this signature phenomenal feeling? David Chal-\nmers, another phi los o pher, has dubbed this question the \u201chard \nprob lem\u201d of consciousness. Phi los o phers like Nagel and Chal mers, \nboth of  whom are colleagues of mine at NYU, refer to such feel -\nings as qualia.  Neither believes that consciousness can be explained \nscientifically.

In \nother words, when confronted with a theory that is not compatible \nwith physics, they wanted to find a new kind of physics.\nEven among  people who accept that consciousness is a physical \n thing that dies with the body, some have the sense it  will never be \nfigured out\u2014 it\u2019s too hard. But if  Alexander Fleming had concluded \nthat bacterial infections  were too mysterious and hard to bother with \nfinding a treatment, he would not have discovered penicillin. Or if  \nWatson, Crick, and Franklin had de cided that unlocking the secret \nof inheritance was too mysterious and hard, they would not have \ndiscovered DNA. Many more  people would have died of COVID-19 \nif the difficult task of developing a vaccine quickly had not been at -\ntempted. Without  these and many other solutions to difficult sci -\nentific prob  lems, we\u2019d be living in a very diff  er ent world  today.\nThe solution to a scientific prob  lem is, in fact, always somewhat \nmysterious  until it is found.

Unless consciousness is a phenomenon of  the physical \nworld, we cannot study it scientifically.

Instead, what is usu -\nally meant in HOT is a minimal, \u201cthin,\u201d or tacit, notion of personal \ninvolvement\u2014 one that allows you to know that your perceptual \nstates are yours, but without you having to explic itly acknowledge \nthat this is the case. For example, when you enter your home, you \n don\u2019t have to remind yourself  that it is your home. Y ou know it is \nyour home  because your brain has accumulated knowledge about it \nfrom you living  there, and you are well acquainted with its features. \nSimilarly, via lifelong mere acquaintance with your biological home \n(your body) and your psychological home (your mind), you are fa -\nmiliar with what your body and  mental states feel like.

Lau\u2019s theory, \ncalled perceptual real ity monitoring,  proposes that consciousness is \njointly determined by first- order and higher- order states. In his model, \nthe higher- order state implicitly indexes or points to the relevant first- \norder sensory information, and distinguishes between sensory states \nthat are real and  those that are imaginary or hallucinated. Indexing, in \nthis use, is a kind of sparse low- level re- description that minimizes the \nneed for the higher- order state to have rich content. A related sparse \nPFC coding view is Stephen Fleming\u2019s higher- order state space (HOSS) \ntheory,  which proposes that the brain uses implicit inferences based on \nbeliefs about learned first- order perceptual repre sen ta tions of  the world \nto construct higher- order states.  These two sparse theories bear some \nrelation to the more general notion that concepts are implicit semantic \npointers.\nAxel Cleeremans\u2019s version of HOT is called the self- organizing \nmetarepre sen ta tional  theory. It proposes that consciousness depends on \nrich higher- order pro cessing based on previous learning drawn from \nlower- order states.  Because the learning involved can be rather  simple \nand automatic, he emphasizes the term \u201cre- description\u201d rather than, or \nin addition to, re- representation as a pro cess under lying higher- order \nstates. Cleeremans suggests that the universal availability of informa -\ntion in the global workspace is a consequence of   these learned higher- \norder re- descriptions.\nRichard Brown\u2019s higher- order repre sen ta tion of a repre sen ta tion \n(HOROR)  theory , unlike all of  the  others mentioned, minimizes the \nessentiality of first- order states\u2014 a view supported by findings showing \nthat following damage to the visual cortex one can have a conscious \nvisual experience in the absence of a first- order state. Similar to Rosen -\nthal\u2019s foundational HOT, and unlike most other higher- order theorists, \nBrown emphasizes rich pro cessing based in part on rich memory.

This question came to the fore in the 1990s through the writ -\nings of Francis Crick and Christof Koch. Noting that pro  gress in \nunderstanding consciousness was stalled, they suggested that  because \nso much was known about the visual system, a focus on visual aware -\nness might be a useful strategy for making headway.\nFrom existing lit er a ture, Crick and Koch proposed that connec -\ntions between the visual cortex and the PFC (by which they meant \nthe lateral, granular PFC) might be impor  tant. Specifically, they \nargued that  because the PFC receives input from the late stages of \nvisual pro cessing, but not from the early stages,  people are conscious \nonly of visual information received from the late visual stages.\nAlthough the idea that the PFC is impor  tant for consciousness \nwas not novel, Crick\u2019s fame from his role in the discovery of DNA \nmeant that it grabbed the attention of phi los o phers, psychologists, \nneuroscientists, biologists, mathematical modelers, physicists, and the \npress. The Crick and Koch papers, in short, jump- started con-\ntemporary enthusiasm for scientific studies of visual consciousness. \nThe fact is, since the late nineteenth  century, consciousness research \nhas mostly focused on vision, and for precisely the reason that Crick \nand Koch identified.

He referred to  these as noetic \nand autonoetic  consciousness.\nNoetic states of consciousness have  mental content based on se -\nmantic facts and conceptions about the world. They often involve \nschema, which, as  we\u2019ve seen, provide conceptual templates that give \nmeaning to the objects and situations we encounter in life. States of \nautonoetic  consciousness, by contrast, have episodic  mental content in \nwhich \u201cyou\u201d are the entity that had the experience. Tulving there -\nfore proposed that the two kinds of consciousness  were associated \nwith distinct kinds of knowledge. Noetic states, he said, come with \nfactual (including conceptual) knowledge, while autonoetic states \ncome with personal knowledge about who you are.\nPerhaps the most celebrated feature of autonoetic consciousness \nis  mental time travel.  When Locke said that, through memory, we \nknow we are the same person  today as in the past, he was, in effect, \nreferring to the ability to engage in  mental time travel. Similarly, \nwhen William  James wrote, \u201cMemory requires more than mere \ndating of a fact. It must be dated in my past,\u201d he too had something \nlike  mental time travel in mind.\nIn addition to allowing you to construct episodes from your life\u2019s \npast, episodic autonoetic consciousness allows you to mentally expe -\nrience the pre sent, and to imagine pos si ble situations that may occur \nin your  future life. Paraphrasing the neuroscientist Gy\u00f6rgy Buzs\u00e1ki, \nepisodic memory functions like a search engine that we use to con -\nstruct the past, pre sent, and  future.

This refers to a situation \nin which one is, for example, unable to recall someone\u2019s name but \nis confident that they know it. T ypically, an entire complex of in -\nformation about the person can be explic itly known (their age, hair \ncolor, ethnicity, personality traits, and so on), despite the inability \nto come up with their name. Zolt\u00e1n Dienes has obtained scientific \nsupport for the idea that  people can be confident of knowing that \nthey know something (it feels familiar) but without knowing what \nor how they know it.\nConsistent with this line of  thought, Asher Koriat has referred \nto such vague fringe feelings as sheer subjective experiences.   These, he \nsaid, depend on implicit inferences  shaped by unconscious pro cesses \nthat monitor memory states and yield a pre sent or absent conclu -\nsion, rather than the specific content that you feel you know. This \nunconscious monitoring of memory has been called procedural or \nimplicit meta- cognition. Stephen Fleming has recently made a similar \npoint\u2014 that being able to report on  whether something is pre sent \nor absent is diff  er ent than being able to report about one\u2019s awareness \nof the item in question.\nWhy does consciousness have a dual organ ization consisting of \na tacit fringe component and an explicit focal condition? Mangan \nexplains this situation as a tradeoff. Through working memory, \nstimuli can be selected and attended to in focal consciousness, and \nresult in articulatable (introspectable and reportable) content. Fringe \nstates accompany explicit conscious states and imbue them with a \nfeeling of familiarity and rightness, but in  doing so make minimal \ndemands on working memory and articulation resources.

As William  James and  others have pointed out, \n\u201cthe feeling of an absence is diff  er ent from the absence of a feeling.\u201d\nOther evidence comes from states of depersonalization, such as \nin psychosis, or when one is  under the influence of psychedelic sub -\nstances. For example, Kalina Christoff and colleagues note that one \ncan feel like a bystander, watching the body responses and  mental \nstates of another person, when in such a state. Of par  tic u lar interest, \nChristoff\u2019s team identified a functional disconnection in such states \nbetween the meso- cortical PFC component of  the default mode \nnetwork (involved in body and  mental state owner  ship) and the me -\ndial frontal pole (involved in cognitive pro cesses that underlie one\u2019s \ninner narration of  who one is). Importantly, the effects on owner-\nship preceded the cognitive effects. This is consistent with the pos -\nsibility that tacit anoetic awareness of owner  ship typically adds \nfeelings of rightness to momentary explicit noetic and autonoetic \nawareness. This dissociation highlights the importance of keeping \nseparate the sub- granular meso- cortical areas and granular neocor -\ntical areas in the medial wall of  the hemi sphere.\nIt is impor  tant to distinguish between conditions where one\u2019s \nbody does not feel right from situations where the rightness of \nowner  ship is lost. For example, if you are nauseous, have a head -\nache, are dizzy, or other wise feel sick, your body does not feel right. \nSimilarly, if you are depressed, your body can feel tired and / or \nheavy. But  these feelings of  wrongness about the body come with \ncontent- dependent explicit awareness about one\u2019s body states. In \nother words, in  these situations anoesis, noesis, and autonoesis are \ninteracting properly.

Hakwan Lau and I proposed that for modality- specific noetic \nperceptual experiences, the re- representation / re- descriptions \nunder lying anoesis typically involve the activity of  the sensory cir-\ncuits that are presently engaged in perception.  Because deeply \nlearned activity of a certain type has routinely occurred in some set \nof  these sensory cir  cuits during similar situations in the past, the kind \nof sensory activity pre sent now helps make the pre sent experience \nfeel familiar.

But even in adults, \nthe non- conscious under pinnings of emotions are not always precise \nenough to produce an experience that is clearly identified with a common \nemotion word. One may feel uncomfortable, concerned, or distressed \nin a situation, and not pro gress to something more specific. But as the \nsituation unfolds and more information is collected, it is also pos si ble that \na vague feeling may turn into one labeled and experienced as fear, which \nmight, with additional information, morph into anger, jealousy, or relief.\n Earlier I mentioned Marie Vandekerckhove and  Jaak Panksepp\u2019s al -\nternative view of emotions. We agree that for explicit autonoetic fear \nin  humans, anoetic experiences are in the background, overshadowed \nby the more prominent cognitive- based experiences. The main difer -\nence in our views is that for me, cortical re- representation\u2009/\u2009re- description \nby sub- granular, meso- cortical PFC is required for anoetic fringe feel -\nings of fear. By contrast, for them, anoetic fringe feelings of fear arise \ndirectly from subcortical defensive cir  cuits involving the amygdala and \nthe periaqueductal gray area.\nA wider range of lower- order procedural states and brain cir  cuits are \noften re- represented\u2009/\u2009re- described via procedural meta- cognition in \nmeso- cortical PFC cir  cuits to make emotional experiences feel the way \nthey feel than is the case for the experience of  simple sensory percep -\ntions. Remember that each kind of cir  cuit undergoes deep learning of \nstatical normality, and many more cir  cuits are involved in emotional than \nperceptual pro cessing.\nBody states are often discussed as a key  factor under lying emotional \nfeelings. But it is impor tant to note that not all instances of fear or other \nemotions come with predictable body responses.  People can feel fear \ndespite the absence of robust physiological arousal.

For me, all emotions are  mental simulations\u2014 that is, all are psy -\nchological inventions (that is, narrations) based on  mental models. Body \nfeedback can be part of  the lower- order amalgam, but it is not neces -\nsary. I do not subscribe to the distinction between innate basic and cul -\nturally acquired secondary emotions. Similarly, Lisa Barrett, Kristen \nLindquist, Gerald Clore, Andrew Ortony, and other cognitive theorists \nreject this distinction.\nEarly in cognitive science, cognition and emotion  were treated as \nopposites\u2014 cognition was thought to be based on conscious reason \n(it\u00a0 was rational), and emotion was based on unconscious passion \n(it\u00a0was irrational). But cognition and emotion are no longer so narrowly \nconceived\u2014 cognition now includes non- rational pro cesses such as intu -\nitions and motivations.

A critic from the ra -\ntional camp could argue that if fear relies on a rational cognitive interpreta -\ntion, then why is one afraid when they know they have no objective reason \nto be so? But, as just noted,  mental models are dynamic, and  people can \nhold conflicting thoughts and beliefs unconsciously, and shift between \nthem moment to moment in consciousness. Love can turn into jealousy, \njealousy to anger, and anger to fear, all in a  matter of seconds.\nWhat good is consciousness, including conscious emotions like fear? \nNathanial Daw and I have suggested that consciousness, including con -\nscious fear, opens novel ave nues of decision- making via conscious delib -\neration. This advantage, which depends on working memory, is admittedly \nnegated when cognitive resources are drained by overwhelming danger \nin\u00a0 the moment, or by anxiety in the absence of  actual danger.

Darwin realized that treating \n human bodies as the product of  biological forces, rather than as a gift \nfrom God, would be an uphill  battle in a Victorian culture  shaped \nby the Anglican Church. He became less vocal about his theory , and \nheld back on publishing it  until he could make a stronger case.\nIn 1859, more than twenty years  after the exchange with Wedg -\nwood, he published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natu ral Se-\nlection; or, The Preservation of Favored Races in the Strug gle for Life.  In \nit, he focused on the gradual evolution of animal bodies, hardly \nmentioning  humans. Still, it did not go over well with the En glish \n people.\nDarwin\u2019s next book, The Descent of Man, and Se lection in Relation \nto Race,  was not published for another de cade. Fi nally he took the \nstep, asking \u201c whether man, like  every other species, is descended \nfrom some pre- existing form.\u201d Using anatomical and  mental simi -\nlarities, he concluded that we had indeed evolved from animals. \nMost impor  tant for our purposes, he noted that \u201c there is no funda -\nmental difference between man and the higher mammals in their \n mental faculties.\u201d\nBut rather than cata loguing the animal features of  human minds, \nhe began to discuss animal minds in  human terms. Why did he take \nthis strange turn? Elizabeth Knoll, writing about Darwin\u2019s strug gles, \nargued that he was troubled by the tepid, and sometimes hostile, \nreception to his views on evolution, and he hoped that this \u201cmore \ncheerful view\u201d might help the public come to accept his theory.\nThis new approach was especially evident the next year in The \nExpression of  the Emotions in Man and the Animals.

The psychologist Fred Keller has pointed \nout that Darwin\u2019s use of anecdotes to explain animal be hav ior in \nterms of  human  mental states was a glaring deviation from the \u201cself-  \ncritical zeal that marked his biological endeavors.\u201d\nDarwin\u2019s anecdotal approach had a tremendous influence on the \nbudding field of animal psy chol ogy in the late nineteenth  century. \nGeorges Romanes, a leading figure and devoted follower of Darwin, \nannounced that be hav ior is an ambassador of  the animal\u2019s mind. \nRampant use of anecdotes about the  mental  causes of animal be hav-\niors continued into the early twentieth  century and was one of  the \nleading  factors that led to the rise of  behaviorism, and hence the \nrejection, for de cades, of  mental states as explanations of  be hav ior \nin psy chol ogy.\nAs the influence of  the behaviorists began to weaken in the \nmid-twentieth  century, anthropomorphic explanations of animal \nbe hav ior unfortunately returned.

I start by considering the brain mechanisms of an -\noetic, noetic, and autonoetic consciousness in  humans. This then \nprovides a way to reverse engineer what kind or kinds of conscious -\nness might be pre sent in diff  er ent mammals, given anatomical simi -\nlarities and differences between their brain and ours.\nFor example, sub- granular meso- cortical PFC areas are shared by \nall mammals. Therefore, what ever kind of consciousness  these areas \nenable in  humans may also be pre sent, at least to some extent, in \nnon- human primates and in non- primate mammals. Since all an -\nthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and  humans) have granular areas \nof PFC, but other mammals do not, what ever roles that granular \nPFC areas play in  human consciousness may also be pre sent in some \nform in other primates, but would be lacking in non- primate mam -\nmals.  Because early evolving primates (that is, prosimians and tar -\nsiers) have only the primitive beginnings of granular PFC, their \nconscious capacities, if  they have them, likely fall between what \nmonkeys and non- primate mammals possess.

But lack of clarity about what \n\u201csentience\u201d actually means makes the claims difficult to evaluate.\nThe simplest definition of sentience is the sheer ability to respond \nto sensory stimuli. As I noted  earlier, a paper by Merker is often \ncited as evidence for sentience in animals. But in using responsive -\nness to sensory stimuli as the criterion, Merker only showed instances \nof creature consciousness (the condition of  being alive and respon -\nsive to sensory stimuli). What most who use the term sentience are \ntrying to get at is the possibility that sensory-motor responsiveness \ndemonstrates that animals have the phenomenal feeling of  what it is \nlike to be conscious, something we  humans assume, from our experi -\nences, that we possess. But mental state consciousness cannot be \ndemonstrated by mea  sur ing sensory responsiveness.

But first-order theories of \nhuman consciousness (see Chapter 21) are non-cognitive mental state \ntheories. While I believe that a higher-order explanation is required \nfor complex human experiences, it is possible that autonoesis and \nnoesis not only overshadow anoesis, but also obscure primitive under -\nlying non-cognitive mental states in us. I don\u2019t subscribe to this idea, \nbut neither do I completely rule out this possibility. If sentience and \nfirst-order mental states turn out to be one and the same in humans, \nit would open the door for first-order sentience having a long evolu -\ntionary history.

The sleep researcher Allan Hobson has argued that dreaming \nis a potent, naturally occurring form of narrative / confabulation, \nnot unlike hallucinations in schizo phre nia.\nAccording to Lisa Bortolotti, \u201c People who confabulate know \nwhat their attitudes and choices are, but do not have access to key \ninformation about the formation of   those.\u201d \u00d6rulv and Hyd\u00e9n iden -\ntified several problem- solving functions of confabulations: sense- \nmaking to understand the pre sent; self- making to maintain personal \nidentity; and world- making to or ga nize interactions with the outer \nworld. One way to think about all this is that confabulations are \ncalled on when ordinary narrations are insufficient to sustain a  \nJamesian feeling of rightness.\nHealthy  people use episodic memory to construct narratives that \nconnect ele ments of  thoughts about events into a coherent under -\nstanding of  who one is and why they do what they do. This is dra -\nmatically illustrated by reflections from a patient who,  because of  \nbrain damage, temporarily lost episodic memory and the ability to \ncreate narrations, including confabulations: \u201cI did not have the \nability to think about the  future\u2014to worry, to anticipate or per -\nceive it. . . .

Not controlled or \ndetermined by, but instead, constrained by.
